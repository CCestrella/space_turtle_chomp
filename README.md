## Shelly The Turtleüê¢üåå

Welcome to **Shelly The Turtle**! This is a simple, fun, and interactive turtle graphics game that I developed during the **She Codes Plus** one-day Python workshop. 

## About the Project
This project was originally inspired by a game created by Christian Thompson (aka [@TokyoEdTech](https://twitter.com/TokyoEdTech)). The game was transcribed and adapted by Kieran McCluskey with assistance from Adrian Smith, and reformatted specifically for She Codes Australia by Ben Fitzhardinge. I've made my own tweaks and improvements as part of my learning experience with Python and game development.

## Game Objective
The goal of Space Turtle Chomp is to control the **green turtle** and collect as many food items as possible within a set time limit. You‚Äôre competing against a **red turtle opponent**‚Äîwhoever has the higher score at the end of the game wins!

## Features
- **Player Control**: Use arrow keys to move the turtle and control its speed.
- **Opponent Turtle**: The red turtle competes against you to collect food items.
- **Scoring**: Each food item collected increases the score.
- **Sound Effects**: Sounds play on collision with walls or food items (requires `pygame`).
- **Timer**: The game has a set time limit (default: 1 minute).

## How to Play
1. **Movement**:
   - **‚¨ÖÔ∏è Left Arrow**: Turn left.
   - **‚û°Ô∏è Right Arrow**: Turn right.
   - **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Up Arrow**: Increase speed.
   - **‚¨áÔ∏è Down Arrow**: Decrease speed.


2. **Objective**:
   - Collect as many food items as you can before time runs out.
   - Avoid getting outscored by the red opponent turtle!

3. **Scoring**:
   - Your score is displayed in the top-left corner.
   - The opponent‚Äôs score is displayed in the top-right corner.
   - When the time is up, a message will display whether you won or lost based on the score.
